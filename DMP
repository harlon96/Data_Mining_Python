Here is a link 🖇️ to the video I created on my LinkedIn profile.

#The red letter day is March 11, when US central bank the Federal Reserve will end the bank term 
#funding program (BTFP), a year after it began in response to the failures of regional banks Signature, 
#Silvergate and Silicon Valley. These banks were brought down by customers withdrawing deposits en masse, 
#both because many were tech or crypto businesses that needed money to cover losses, and because there 
#were better savings rates available elsewhere.

#The forces that consumed three regional lenders last March have left hundreds of smaller banks wounded, 
#as merger activity — a key potential lifeline — has slowed to a trickle.
#Klaros Group analyzed about 4,000 institutions and found 282 with both high levels of commercial real 
#estate exposure and large unrealized losses from the rate surge — which may force these lenders to raise 
#fresh capital or merge.
#Behind the scenes, regulators have been prodding banks with confidential orders to improve capital levels 
#and staffing, according to Klaros co-founder Brian Graham.

I added two ways to go-to the YouTube Channel FDIC streaming site from my jupyter_notebook..

Hope you like it! I am trying to change the projects up a little bit...
